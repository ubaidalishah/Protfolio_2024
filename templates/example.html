    <p>I have completed an IoT-based muscle monitoring system designed to specifically monitor bicep and tricep muscles. This system provides real-time feedback to help users correct their posture and maintain optimal form during physical activities. By utilizing advanced sensors and data analysis, the project aims to enhance performance and prevent injuries.</p>
